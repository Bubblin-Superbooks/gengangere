It would have been a poor look-out for me many a time but for the Reverend Mr. Manders.</p><p>MANDERS. And this is how you reward me! You cause me to enter falsehoods in the Church Register, and you withhold from me, year after year, the explanations you owed alike to me and to the truth. Your conduct has been wholly inexcusable, Engstrand; and from this time forward I have done with you!</p><p>ENGSTRAND. [With a sigh.] Yes! I suppose there's no help for it.</p><p>MANDERS. How can you possibly justify yourself?</p><p>ENGSTRAND. Who could ever have thought she'd have gone and made bad worse by talking about it?
