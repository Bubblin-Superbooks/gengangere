ALVING. To drink? What do you want to drink now?</p><p>OSWALD. Oh, anything you like. You have some cold punch in the house.</p><p>MRS. ALVING. Yes, but my dear Oswald—</p><p>OSWALD. Don't refuse me, mother. Do be kind, now! I must have something to wash down all these gnawing thoughts. [Goes into the conservatory.] And then—it's so dark here! [MRS. ALVING pulls a bell-rope on the right.] And this ceaseless rain! It may go on week after week, for months together. Never to get a glimpse of the sun! I can't recollect ever having seen the sun shine all the times I've been at home.</p><p>MRS. ALVING. Oswald—you are thinking of going away from me.</p></div> </div>
