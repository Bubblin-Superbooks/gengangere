<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">I have never dared to say anything. Well! now my boy shall speak for me.</p><p>MANDERS. You are greatly to be pitied, Mrs. Alving. But now I must speak seriously to you. And now it is no longer your business manager and adviser, your own and your husband's early friend, who stands before you. It is the priestâ€”the priest who stood before you in the moment of your life when you had gone farthest astray.</p><p>MRS. ALVING. And what has the priest to say to me?</p><p>MANDERS. I will first stir up your memory a little. The moment is well chosen. To-morrow will be the tenth anniversary of your husband's death. To-morrow the memorial in his honour will be unveiled. To-morrow I shall have to speak to the whole assembled multitude. But to-day I will speak to you alone.</p><p>MRS. ALVING. Very well, Pastor Manders. Speak.</p></div> </div>
