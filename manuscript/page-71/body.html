<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>MANDERS. You are going to pass the winter at home, I hear.</p><p>OSWALD. My stay is indefinite, sir. But, ah! it is good to be at home!</p><p>MRS. ALVING. [Beaming.] Yes, isn't it, dear?</p><p>MANDERS. [Looking sympathetically at him.] You went out into the world early, my dear Oswald.</p><p>OSWALD. I did. I sometimes wonder whether it wasn't too early.</p><p>MRS. ALVING. Oh, not at all. A healthy lad is all the better for it; especially when he's an only child. He oughtn't to hang on at home with his mother and father, and get spoilt.</p><p>MANDERS. That is a very disputable point, Mrs. Alving. A child's proper place is, and must be, the home of his fathers.</p><p>OSWALD. There I quite agree with you, Pastor Manders.</p></div> </div>
